  abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is {$\sim$}0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

Here we report an atypical absence of ON-type bipolar cell response in a Japanese patient with autosomal dominant macular dystrophy (adMD). To identify a causal genetic mutation for the adMD, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on four affected and four-non affected members of the family for three generations, and identified a novel p.C538Y mutation in a post-synaptic gene, LRRTM4. WES analysis revealed seven rare genetic variations in patients. We further referred to our in-house WES data from 1360 families with inherited retinal diseases, and found that only p.C538Y mutation in LRRTM4 was associated with adMD-affected patients. Combinatorial filtration using public database of single-nucleotide polymorphism frequency and genotype-phenotype annotated database identified novel mutation in atypical adMD.},

The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5\textendash 20 min, depending on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift-dna.org).},

  abstract = {Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a hereditary early-onset retinal dystrophy that is accompanied by severe macular degeneration. In this study, novel compound heterozygous mutations were identified as LCA-causative in chaperonin-containing TCP-1, subunit 2 (CCT2), a gene that encodes the molecular chaperone protein, CCT{$\beta$}. The zebrafish mutants of CCT{$\beta$} are known to exhibit the eye phenotype while its mutation and association with human disease have been unknown. The CCT proteins (CCT {$\alpha$}-\texttheta ) forms ring complex for its chaperon function. The LCA mutants of CCT{$\beta$}, T400P and R516H, are biochemically instable and the affinity for the adjacent subunit, CCT{$\gamma$}, was affected distinctly in both mutants. The patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), carrying these CCT{$\beta$} mutants, were less proliferative than the control iPSCs. Decreased proliferation under Cct2 knockdown in 661W cells was significantly rescued by wild-type CCT{$\beta$} expression. However, the expression of T400P and R516H didn't exhibit the significant effect. In mouse retina, both CCT{$\beta$} and CCT{$\gamma$} are expressed in the retinal ganglion cells and connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. The Cct2 knockdown decreased its major client protein, transducing {$\beta$}1 (G{$\beta$}1). Here we report the novel LCA mutations in CCT{$\beta$} and the impact of chaperon disability by these mutations in cellular biology.},

The purpose of this study was to identify novel mutations of C21orf2 associated with syndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy (arCRD) by using whole exome sequencing of a Japanese cohort. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA from affected and healthy members from 147 families with retinal degenerations. Identified nonsense and missense mutations were further restricted by using the reported single nucleotide variation frequencies and inherited patterns. The effect of the mutations was examined by in vitro assays. RESULTS: Novel mutations in C21orf2 were found in Japanese patients with arRP with skeletal defects or arCRD. Compound heterozygous mutations, from one family (p.V111M and p.Y107H), and a homozygous mutation, from another family (p.Y107C), were all located in the leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain required for protein stabilization. C21orf2 was expressed in the retina through the developing to the mature stage, and the protein localized to the photoreceptor cilia in the adult retina. In vitro expression showed reduced levels and affected localizations of mutated protein products compared to the wild type. CONCLUSIONS: The identified C21orf2 mutations decreased protein stability and affected cytoplasmic localization of C21orf2. Since C21orf2 was required for ciliogenesis, our data suggested that reduced levels of functional C21orf2 induced photoreceptor degradation through abnormal cilia formation, leading to arRP or arCRD in the retina.},

Pathogenicity prediction tools are commonly used as part of the expert interpretation of somatic variants, but most of these tools were initially developed for germline variants. Our aim was to benchmark their performance for somatic variants. A gold standard~list was assembled of 4319 somatic single-nucleotide variants, classified as oncogenic (n = 2996) or neutral (n = 1323), based on their presence in curated databases or on their allele frequency in the general population. These variants were annotated with the most commonly used prediction tools [Database for Nonsynonymous SNPs' Functional Predictions (dbNSFP) and Universal Mutation Database Predictor (UMD-Predictor)] and computed performance calculations. Stratification of the prediction tools based on Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve allowed the identification of the top-performing ones, namely, Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD), Eigen or Eigen Principal Components (Eigen-PC), Polymorphism Phenotyping version 2 (PolyPhen-2), Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN), UMD-Predictor, and Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL). Interestingly, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), which is a commonly used prediction tool for somatic variants, was ranked in the second performance category. Combining tools two by two only marginally improved performances, mainly because of the occurrence of discordant predictions.},

The purpose of this study was to identify pathogenic EYS variants, to determine the clinical/genetic spectrum of EYS-associated retinal disease (EYS-RD), and to discover disease-associated variants with relatively high allele frequency (1\%-10\%) in a nationwide Japanese cohort. Sixty-six affected subjects from 61 families with biallelic or multiple pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were ascertained by whole-exome sequencing. Three phenotype groups were identified in EYS-RD: retinitis pigmentosa (RP; 85.94\%), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD; 10.94\%), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA; 3.12\%). Twenty-six pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were identified, including seven novel variants. The two most prevalent variants, p.(Gly843Glu) and p.(Thr2465Ser) were found in 26 and twelve families (42.6\%, 19.7\%), respectively, for which the allele frequency (AF) in the Japanese population was 2.2\% and 3.0\%, respectively. These results expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of EYS-RD, accounting for a high proportion of EYS-RD both in autosomal recessive RP (23.4\%) and autosomal recessive CORD (9.9\%) in the Japanese population. The presence of EYS variants with relatively high AF highlights the importance of considering the pathogenicity of non-rare variants in relatively prevalent Mendelian disorders.},
